# Week 1 fail log
Anxious. Stressed. Feeling rather unmoored. 
I am going to start teaching myself DH. Well, not teaching myself, really. I have a lovely guide. But it's a little lonely being a class of one.

## Commitment One
I am going to slowly get my feet under me in the Crafting Digital History course Mr. Shawn suggested I take a peek at. This seems like a good place to start.

## Commitment Two
Mr. Shawn also suggested some other resources. There are courses. There are tutorials. There are... good lord, all the things in the world. Okay, stop. Start small. I am going to sit down and write out the things I need to learn. That, in itself, is a daunting task. 

## Commitment Three
Once I have calmed the panic I am already feeling rising just having to do this exercise (there's not enough time! there's not enough time! there are too many things to know! I don't know where to start! etc...), I am going to outline a clear path to accomplish one of the things I need to know. I am then going to hop on to the Mattermost forum and see if anyone wants to join me in my adventures.

## Comments/Concerns

Well, all of the things. Yes, all of them. But this is why I started very small. With some commitments. And go from there we shall.
